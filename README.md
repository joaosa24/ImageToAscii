# Image to ASCII Converter

This Java program converts an image file into ASCII art representation. It reads an image file specified by the user, processes it, and generates a text file containing ASCII characters that represent the brightness levels of the pixels in the image.
## How to Use:
### Clone the Repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/joaosa24/ImageToAscii.git

java ImageToAscii
```
Enter Image Path:
When prompted, enter the full path to the image file you want to convert. Make sure the image file exists and is accessible from the location where you are running the program.

Here's a simple example of how to use the program:
```bash
  Enter the path to the image file: /path/to/your/image.jpg
